What Zomato Uses
Zomato has used a combination of:

PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geospatial queries (e.g., nearby restaurants)

Elasticsearch for search + location (e.g., “restaurants near Indiranagar”)

Redis or in-memory caching for fast read access

Possibly Kafka + Cassandra for real-time location tracking/logging in delivery

They don’t need the same frequency of updates as Uber, but they do need fast "restaurants near me" queries and tracking of delivery partners.








1. B-Tree
Purpose: General-purpose ordered index for one-dimensional keys (e.g. integers, strings).

Structure:

A height-balanced tree where each node holds up to M keys and M+1 child pointers.

All leaves are at the same depth.

Operations:

Search: Descend from root, at each node do a binary‐search over the keys → O(logₘ N) disk I/Os.

Insert/Delete: May split or merge nodes to keep the tree balanced; also O(logₘ N).

Use Cases: Primary index in most relational databases, file systems.

2. R-Tree
Purpose: Index for spatial objects (points, rectangles, polygons) in 2D (or higher) by bounding-box hierarchies.

Structure:

Tree of variable-capacity nodes.

Each node entry is a Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) plus a pointer to child node (or object at leaf).

Child MBRs at the same level may overlap.

Operations:

Search (e.g. range, nearest): Recursively visit only those branches whose MBR intersects the query window or circle.

Insert: Choose leaf whose MBR needs least enlargement to accommodate the new object; may cause node split.

Delete: Remove entry and possibly condense tree.

Complexity: Average-case search ~O(log N), but worst-case can degrade if MBRs overlap heavily.

Use Cases: GIS applications, PostGIS, spatial extensions in databases.

3. Geohash
Purpose: Encode a 2D latitude/longitude coordinate into a single scalar string or integer that preserves spatial locality.

Mechanism:

Interleave bits of latitude and longitude after mapping each to a fixed-precision integer (Morton or Z-curve).

Convert the interleaved bit‐string to base32 (or base-10) to get a short human-readable “hash.”

Properties:

Nearby points often share a common prefix → easy to group into a rectangular grid of cells.

The longer the prefix, the smaller (higher-precision) the cell.

Queries:

To find neighbors within a region, compute the geohash of the query point at the desired precision, then include its adjacent cells (up to 8 neighbors).

Use Cases: Sharding and bucketing in NoSQL stores, Redis GEO, simple proximity search.

4. BKD-Tree (Block KD-Tree)
Purpose: Multidimensional numeric indexing for points and ranges (especially in Lucene/Elasticsearch).

Structure:

A disk-efficient variant of a KD-tree that packs many points into “blocks” (leaf blocks) and indexes them in a single axis‐aligned hierarchy.

Internal nodes split the space along one dimension at a time, cycling through dimensions (e.g. lat, then lon, then lat…).

Leaf nodes hold contiguous ranges of points stored on disk in sorted form.

Operations:

Search: Traverse internal splits to find all leaf blocks whose bounding boxes intersect the query region, then scan those blocks.

Built once: Typically built in batch; not optimized for frequent incremental inserts.

Complexity: Query ~O(log N + K) where K is number of reporting points; very I/O-efficient due to block layout.

Use Cases: Elasticsearch’s geo_point and numeric indices, high-performance multidimensional filtering.

⚖️ Quick Comparison

B-Tree	1D	Excellent	Equality, range	Indexing sorted scalar keys
R-Tree	2D+	Good	Spatial range, nearest	Indexing variable-size objects
Geohash	2D → 1D	Trivial	Proximity (grid cells)	Simple bucketing/sharding
BKD-Tree	N-D	Poor (batch-load)	Multidimensional range	High-throughput filtering

Quad Tree vs R-Tree vs Geohash
===============================

1. Quad Tree
------------
Concept:
- A hierarchical data structure that recursively divides a 2D space into four quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE).

How it works:
- Starts with a bounding box (the whole space).
- If a region has more than a threshold number of points, it's subdivided into 4 equal rectangles.
- This continues until each leaf node meets the threshold.

Use Cases:
- Efficient for 2D point data (e.g., gaming maps, image processing, GIS).
- Good for range queries (e.g., “find all points in this rectangle”).

Pros:
- Easy to implement.
- Works well with uniformly distributed spatial data.
- Naturally supports range queries and nearest neighbor searches.

Cons:
- Can become unbalanced with skewed data.
- Doesn't handle high-dimensional or non-point geometries well.

2. R-Tree
---------
Concept:
- A height-balanced tree (like B-Trees) used to index multi-dimensional data using bounding rectangles (MBRs).

How it works:
- Nodes contain rectangles that bound the geometries (points, lines, polygons).
- Leaf nodes store data entries; internal nodes store MBRs of children.
- Insertion tries to minimize MBR area increase.

Use Cases:
- Spatial databases (e.g., PostGIS, Oracle Spatial).
- Great for spatial queries like intersection, containment, and nearest neighbor for complex shapes.

Pros:
- Efficient for indexing and querying arbitrary geometries.
- Handles skewed distributions better than Quad Trees.
- Good for spatial joins.

Cons:
- Complex insertion/deletion.
- Performance can degrade with overlapping MBRs in high dimensions.

3. Geohash
----------
Concept:
- A string-based spatial index that encodes latitude/longitude into a base32 hash.

How it works:
- Recursively divides the globe into a grid, alternating between lat/lon.
- Each cell gets a unique alphanumeric string.
- Longer geohashes = more precise.

Use Cases:
- Location-based services, key-value store indexing (e.g., Redis).
- Fast prefix-based proximity lookups.

Pros:
- Fast string-based lookups.
- Easy to shard spatial data.
- Works well in distributed systems.

Cons:
- Poor for range queries across cell boundaries.
- Nearby locations may not share prefixes.
