In a hld question I am using a sql or nosql db to store data and elasticsearch for search, what's the best way to update elasticsearch when primary db is updated


ChatGPT said:
When using a primary database (SQL or NoSQL) alongside Elasticsearch for full-text search, it's crucial to keep Elasticsearch in sync with your source of truth. Here are the best practices to update Elasticsearch reliably:

✅ Recommended Approach: Change Data Capture (CDC) + Async Indexing
1. Capture DB Changes (CDC)
Use Change Data Capture (CDC) to detect updates in the primary DB. This avoids directly coupling your application logic with Elasticsearch.

SQL DBs: Use tools like:

Debezium (Apache Kafka Connect-based, works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

Triggers + outbox table (application-managed)

NoSQL DBs: Use native features or logs:

MongoDB: Change Streams

DynamoDB: Streams

2. Publish Changes to a Message Queue
Publish the changes to a message broker (like Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.). Each change should include:

Record ID

Operation type (insert/update/delete)

Updated fields (or entire object)

3. Indexing Service Reads the Queue
Have a dedicated Elasticsearch Indexing Service that:

Consumes the change events from the queue

Applies them to Elasticsearch:

Inserts or updates the document

Deletes from ES if deleted in DB

⚙️ Alternative Approaches (Less Reliable or More Complex)
🔁 1. Direct Sync from Application Code
Update Elasticsearch from your service code every time you update the DB.

✅ Simple

❌ Risk of inconsistencies if one operation succeeds but the other fails

❌ Adds tight coupling and latency

📅 2. Scheduled Batch Sync
Run a batch job every X minutes to sync the DB and Elasticsearch.

✅ Easy to set up

❌ Not real-time

❌ Can become costly or slow for large datasets

🛡️ Bonus: Ensure Resilience
Use retry queues or dead-letter queues for failed updates

Maintain idempotency in Elasticsearch update handlers

Consider a read repair job for eventual consistency

💡 Summary Recommendation
For production-ready systems (especially HLD interview design):

Use CDC (like Debezium or MongoDB Change Streams) → Publish to Kafka → Indexing Service updates Elasticsearch asynchronously.

This gives decoupled, resilient, real-time syncing, which scales well and handles failures gracefully.
