üü¢ Latency:
- Time taken for a single request to complete.
- Goal: Minimize it (e.g., 100ms for search).
- Lower latency = better UX.

üü¢ Throughput:
- Number of requests handled per unit time.
- Goal: Maximize it (e.g., 1000 TPS).
- Batch jobs, queues ‚Üí care more about this.

üü¢ Availability:
- % of time system is up.
- 99.9% uptime = ~43 mins downtime/month.
- Use redundancy + failover to increase.

üü¢ Scalability:
- System‚Äôs ability to handle growth.
- Vertical = scale up (CPU/RAM).
- Horizontal = scale out (more machines).
- Use load balancers, sharding, caching.

üü¢ CAP Theorem:
- You can pick only 2: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.
- CP ‚Üí HBase; AP ‚Üí Cassandra; CA ‚Üí Single node DB (not real in distributed systems).


üü¢ PACELC = Partition-Availability-Consistency Else Latency-Consistency
- P ‚Üí Partition
- A ‚Üí Availability
- C ‚Üí Consistency
- E ‚Üí Else (no partition)
- L ‚Üí Latency

üß© During Partition:
- Must choose: Availability (A) or Consistency (C)

üìà Else (Normal State):
- Must choose: Latency (L) or Consistency (C)

üõ†Ô∏è Examples:
- Cassandra: PA/EL (high availability + low latency)
- HBase: PC/EC (strong consistency both in and out of partitions)
- Spanner: PC/EC (globally consistent, higher latency)


üü¢ Partitioning:
- Generic term for splitting data into logical subsets.
- Can be horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns).
- Often used within a single DB.
- Example: PostgreSQL partitioned tables.

üü¢ Sharding:
- A type of horizontal partitioning across machines.
- Each shard is a separate DB/server.
- Helps scale systems horizontally.
- Requires routing logic.
- Example: MongoDB, Cassandra.

üéØ Rule of Thumb:
"All sharding is partitioning, but not all partitioning is sharding."




üìö Day 3: Databases ‚Äì SQL vs NoSQL, Sharding, Replication, Partitioning
‚úÖ 1. SQL vs NoSQL
SQL (Relational Databases)
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server

Schema: Fixed schema; tables with rows and columns.

Data Integrity: Strong ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Best for: Structured data, transactions (e.g., banking, ERP systems).

Advantages:

Joins and relationships are well supported.

Mature ecosystems and tooling.

Complex queries (via SQL) are supported efficiently.

Disadvantages:

Scaling is harder (typically vertical scaling).

Schema evolution is complex.

NoSQL (Non-relational Databases)
Types:

Document: MongoDB, CouchDB

Key-Value: Redis, DynamoDB

Column-Family: Cassandra, HBase

Graph: Neo4j, ArangoDB

Schema: Flexible or schema-less.

Data Integrity: BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency).

Best for: Unstructured or semi-structured data, high-speed data ingestion (e.g., analytics, real-time feeds, IoT).

Advantages:

Horizontally scalable (across machines).

Schema flexibility; easy to evolve.

High availability and performance for large-scale systems.

Disadvantages:

Limited complex querying (e.g., joins).

Less mature tools compared to relational DBs.

‚úÖ 2. Sharding
Definition:
Sharding is a database partitioning technique that splits large datasets into smaller, faster, more manageable pieces called shards, which are stored across multiple servers.

How It Works:
Each shard holds a portion of the data. A shard key is used to determine where to place/read the data.

Example:
User data might be sharded by user ID:

Shard 1 ‚Üí User IDs 1‚Äì10000

Shard 2 ‚Üí User IDs 10001‚Äì20000

Advantages:
Enables horizontal scaling.

Better performance and reduced load per server.

Challenges:
Complex to implement and manage.

Rebalancing shards is hard when one becomes ‚Äúhot‚Äù (uneven traffic).

Cross-shard queries are more expensive.

‚úÖ 3. Replication
Definition:
Replication is the process of copying data from one database server (primary/master) to one or more others (secondary/replicas).

Types:
Master-Slave (Primary-Secondary): Reads from replicas, writes to primary.

Multi-Master: All nodes can accept writes (more complex conflict resolution).

Synchronous vs Asynchronous:

Synchronous: Ensures consistency, but slower.

Asynchronous: Faster, but may lose latest data if primary fails.

Benefits:
High availability.

Fault tolerance.

Load balancing for read operations.

Trade-offs:
Replication lag in asynchronous mode.

Risk of conflicts in multi-master setups.

‚úÖ 4. Partitioning
Definition:
Partitioning splits a database table into smaller parts called partitions, based on a partition key. It‚Äôs internal to a database system (not distributed across different DB servers like sharding).

Types:
Horizontal Partitioning (Row-based):

Rows split based on values (e.g., range, list).

Ex: Orders for India vs US stored in different partitions.

Vertical Partitioning (Column-based):

Splits table by columns.

Ex: Store frequently accessed columns separately for performance.

Hash Partitioning:

Uses a hash function to distribute data evenly.

Useful when range/list-based partitions are skewed.

Advantages:
Improves query performance and maintainability.

Easier backups and purging of old data.

Trade-offs:
Can add complexity in query optimization.

Might require application awareness for partitioning logic.

can explain in detail about ACID and BASE and how SQL databases support ACID and NoSqls BASE


ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Let‚Äôs explore ACID and BASE in detail ‚Äî these are two contrasting models of data consistency and reliability that underpin how SQL and NoSQL databases function.

üîê ACID (SQL Databases)
ACID stands for:

Property	Description
A ‚Äì Atomicity	All operations in a transaction either complete fully or not at all. Partial updates are not allowed.
C ‚Äì Consistency	A transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all rules like constraints, foreign keys, etc.
I ‚Äì Isolation	Concurrent transactions are executed as if sequentially, meaning no interference.
D ‚Äì Durability	Once a transaction is committed, the data is persisted permanently, even after power failures or crashes.

üìò Example: Bank Transfer
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Transfer ‚Çπ1000 from A to B
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE user_id = 'A';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE user_id = 'B';

COMMIT;
If any update fails, the entire transaction rolls back, and the database remains unchanged. This is Atomicity. The balance will never go missing or duplicated ‚Äî thanks to Consistency and Durability. If two transfers happen concurrently, Isolation ensures that one doesn‚Äôt interfere with the other.

‚ö° BASE (NoSQL Databases)
BASE is a softer model often followed by NoSQL systems where high availability and partition tolerance are more important than immediate consistency.

It stands for:

Property	Description
B ‚Äì Basically Available	The system guarantees availability, meaning responses will be returned (even if with stale data).
A ‚Äì Soft State	The system's state may change over time, even without new input, due to eventual consistency or replication.
SE ‚Äì Eventual Consistency	The system will become consistent over time, given no new updates. Not guaranteed to be immediately consistent.

üìò Example: Shopping Cart (NoSQL MongoDB or DynamoDB)
Let‚Äôs say a user adds an item to the cart:

The write goes to a primary node and is asynchronously replicated to secondary nodes.

If another user queries a replica before replication finishes, they might see old data ‚Äî but eventually, all nodes will reflect the updated cart.

This allows:

High write speed,

Scalability,

Better fault tolerance under network partitions.

‚úÖ How SQL Supports ACID
Feature	Implementation
Atomicity	Transaction blocks with rollback if failure occurs.
Consistency	Enforced via foreign keys, constraints, and triggers.
Isolation	Implemented via isolation levels (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE, etc.)
Durability	Write-ahead logs (WAL), journaling, and persistent storage ensure committed data survives crashes.

Most relational DBs like PostgreSQL, MySQL (InnoDB), Oracle are strongly ACID compliant.

‚úÖ How NoSQL Supports BASE
Feature	Implementation
Basically Available	NoSQL systems like Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB prioritize availability over strict consistency.
Soft State	Data in replicas may be stale temporarily; state converges later.
Eventual Consistency	Updates are asynchronously propagated. Reads can be stale unless read-repair or quorum reads are used.

BASE helps with:

Scalability (across data centers or geographies),

High throughput, and

Tolerance to network failures.

‚öñÔ∏è ACID vs BASE: Key Differences
Feature	ACID (SQL)	BASE (NoSQL)
Consistency	Strong, immediate	Eventual
Availability	Can be compromised during failures	Always prioritized
Partition Tolerance	Limited (CAP theorem)	High
Transactions	Full support	Limited or app-level
Use Case	Banking, ERP, Inventory	Analytics, IoT, Social apps

‚úçÔ∏è Quick Revision Notes
Concept	SQL (ACID)	NoSQL (BASE)
Atomicity	All-or-nothing	Not guaranteed
Consistency	Strict, immediate	Eventually consistent
Isolation	Concurrent safety	May allow dirty reads
Durability	Persisted data	May rely on replication
Availability	Not always under failures	Always available
Use Cases	Financial systems	Real-time, scalable apps

Scaling is harder (typically vertical scaling).

Certainly! Let's break it down:

üí° "Scaling is harder (typically vertical scaling)" ‚Äî What Does It Mean?
This statement refers to how traditional SQL (relational) databases are scaled when they need to handle more data, users, or requests.

üîß Types of Scaling
There are two main ways to scale a system:

‚úÖ 1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
Add more power (CPU, RAM, SSD) to a single server.

Example: Upgrading from a 4-core to a 32-core machine, or adding more memory to the server.

SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle are traditionally scaled this way.

Pros:

Simpler to manage (no need to split data).

No data distribution or coordination required.

Cons:

Expensive: High-end hardware costs a lot.

Limits: There‚Äôs a physical ceiling ‚Äî you can‚Äôt scale infinitely.

Downtime: May require downtime to upgrade.

‚ùå 2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
Add more servers/nodes to distribute the load.

Common in NoSQL systems like MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB.

Requires sharding or data partitioning to spread data across multiple nodes.

Pros:

Scales linearly ‚Äî more servers ‚Üí more power.

High availability (even if one node fails).

Cons:

Complex: You must handle data distribution, replication, failover, consistency, etc.

Application must be aware of how data is partitioned or queried across servers.

üß† Why SQL Typically Uses Vertical Scaling
Traditional SQL databases:

Are designed with strict consistency (ACID).

Rely on relational joins, foreign keys, and complex queries that are hard to run across multiple servers.

Sharding a relational schema can be difficult (foreign key relationships may span shards).

Hence:

It's easier to scale them vertically by making the single server stronger ‚Äî rather than trying to distribute data across many machines (which is hard due to joins and transactions).

‚öñÔ∏è Example
Suppose you're using MySQL for an e-commerce app:
Traffic increases ‚Üí queries slow down.

You first try vertical scaling:

Add more CPU cores, more memory, SSD ‚Üí system performs better.

Eventually, even a top-tier server isn‚Äôt enough.

Now, to horizontally scale:

You try read replicas (one master, many slaves).

Then comes the hard part ‚Äî sharding the data across multiple databases (e.g., by customer ID), but your queries become more complex.

JOINs across shards? Very difficult to handle efficiently.

üìù Summary
Scaling Type	SQL Databases (Traditional)
Vertical Scaling	‚úÖ Common, easier
Horizontal Scaling	‚ùå Harder (due to joins, ACID transactions)
Result	Harder to scale compared to NoSQL
